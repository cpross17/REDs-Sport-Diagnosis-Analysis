# RED(s) in Female Athletes: A Sport-Level Risk Framework

This repository supports the research submission to the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 2025 titled:  
**"Are We Missing the Signs? A Sport-Level Analysis of RED(s) Risk, Diagnosis Patterns, and Media Framing in Female Athletes."**

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project investigates whether lower reported rates of RED(s) (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport) in team-based or modestly-uniformed sports reflect truly lower risk—or potential underdiagnosis.  

We reclassified existing studies across key sport-level variables:
- Team vs individual structure
- Uniform modesty
- Aesthetic scoring
- Weigh-in practices
- Endurance vs strength focus

We also analyzed media language across Olympic sports to assess the relationship between body-focused descriptors and known RED(s) risk levels.
